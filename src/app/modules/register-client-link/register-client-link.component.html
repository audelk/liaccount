                            <p>These Ziltrfuin LLC (Local Housing Network) services are a binding agreement between Agent ("Agent"&nbsp; or "you") and Local Housing Network.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><strong>1. Policies.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

                                (collectively, "Policies"). The Policies are incorporated by reference herein and the Local&nbsp; Housing Network may modify the Policies at any time. To the extent there is an inconsistency between a&nbsp; term in this
                                Agreement and a term in the Policies, the term in this Agreement will govern. Local Housing&nbsp; Network reserves the right to terminate a relationship between Agent and Local Housing Network.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>b. Code of Conduct. Local Housing Network believes that all people deserve to be treated equally and&nbsp; with respect, regardless of their race, ethnicity, nationality, class, religion, belief, sex, language, sexual&nbsp;
                                orientation, gender identity, age, health or other status. Local Housing Network chooses to work with&nbsp; professionals who both share these values and embody them in their interactions with consumers, Local&nbsp; Housing

                                including terminating their relationship with Agent.&nbsp;</p>

                                Network&nbsp; site or social media platform; (3) any other scenario where a person contacts the Local Housing Network.&nbsp; If a Local Housing Network agent fails to offer 10% back on closing costs to a lead, or the otherwise&nbsp;

                                including calls and text messages using an automatic telephone&nbsp; dialing system and/or an artificial or prerecorded voice ("Other Messages"). Agent further agrees that&nbsp; such emails, calls and/or text messages may
                                constitute advertising or telemarketing, e.g. Local Housing&nbsp; Network may email, call, or text with information about new service offerings available to Agent. Agent&nbsp; understands that agreeing to receive Other
                                Messages that constitute advertising or telemarketing is not a&nbsp; condition to purchase.&nbsp;</p>

                                lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative&nbsp; proceeding. Further, unless both you and Local Housing Network otherwise agree in writing, the&nbsp; arbitrator may not
                                consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any&nbsp; form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the&nbsp; entirety of
                                this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding&nbsp; sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of this Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>c. Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate&nbsp; commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (the "FAA") governs the interpretation and enforcement&nbsp; of
                                this provision. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA")&nbsp; in accordance with the Consumer.&nbsp; Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by
                                this "Dispute Resolution"&nbsp; section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at&nbsp; 1&ndash;800&ndash;778&ndash;7879.) If the FAA and AAA Rules are found not to apply to any Dispute
                                hereunder, or the&nbsp; enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the State of California without&nbsp; giving effect without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions.&nbsp;</p>
